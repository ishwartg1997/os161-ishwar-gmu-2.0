 * AmigaOS-style linked list of procs.
 *
 * The two proclistnodes in the proclist structure are always on
 * the list, as bookends; this removes all the special cases in the
 * list handling code. However, note how PROCLIST_FOREACH works: you
 * iterate by starting with tl_head.tln_next, and stop when
 * itervar->tln_next is null, not when itervar itself becomes null.
 *
 * ->tln_self always points to the proc that contains the
 * proclistnode. We could avoid this if we wanted to instead use
 *
 *    (struct proc *)((char *)node - offsetof(struct proc, t_listnode))
 *
 * to get the proc pointer. But that's gross.
